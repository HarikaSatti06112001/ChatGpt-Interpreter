# ChatGpt-Interpreter
The repository includes all materials submitted and documented by Harika Satti for the ChatGpt Interpretor. I explored the capabilities of GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code. I set up the necessary environment, generated a project using GPT-Engineer, and created a screencast demonstrating various use cases of GitHub Copilot.
For Assignment 1, the task is to perform data science, preferably involving deep learning, using the ChatGPT code interpreter. This entails selecting a popular dataset from Kaggle, conducting various data science modules similar to the provided example, exporting the chat transcript, and submitting it. Additionally, students are required to publish a Medium article, extracting sections from the output, and generating an informative report on Medium.com. The SaveGPT extension should be utilized to export the work to PDF, with the option to insert images from ChatGPT using the screenshot extension. The best article will be evaluated by fellow students through a poll organized by TAs.

For Assignment 2, the objective is to set up Visual Studio Code and install the GitHub Copilot extension. Numerous resources and guides have been provided to facilitate this process. Additionally, the GitHub Copilot Chat extension should be installed. The assignment further entails using GPT-Engineer to generate a Visual Studio Code project related to the student's favorite application, with various resources and references provided for assistance. A screencast must be created to showcase the functionality of this extension, including tasks like writing code, refactoring, unit testing, and even developing an entire application. The screencast and the code generated during the assignment should be submitted in a GitHub repository, emphasizing the potential of combining the ChatGPT plugin with Visual Studio Code.
