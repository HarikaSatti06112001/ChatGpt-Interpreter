# ChatGpt-Interpreter
The repository includes all materials submitted and documented by Harika Satti for the ChatGpt Interpretor. I explored the capabilities of GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code. I set up the necessary environment, generated a project using GPT-Engineer, and created a screencast demonstrating various use cases of GitHub Copilot.
