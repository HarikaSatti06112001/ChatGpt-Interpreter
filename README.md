# ChatGpt-Interpreter
The repository includes all materials submitted and documented by Harika Satti for the ChatGpt Interpretor. I explored the capabilities of GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code. I set up the necessary environment, generated a project using GPT-Engineer, and created a screencast demonstrating various use cases of GitHub Copilot.

2. Developed a daily journaling application using GPT-Engineer. 
To run it:
i. Clone the repository from: https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer 
ii. Include a workspace folder and a prompt file in the "projects/example" directory.
iii. Install the necessary packages for GPT-Engineer: Use the command "sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev"
iv. Install GPT-Engineer: Execute "make install" 
v. Enter your OpenAI API Key: Set it as an environment variable with "export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your_api_key]"
vi. To start the application: Run "gpt-engineer projects/example"
